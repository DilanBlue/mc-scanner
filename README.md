## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Internet connection

### Download

**Option 1: Download Pre-built JAR**
```bash
# Download from Releases page
# https://github.com/DilanBlue/mc-scanner/releases/latest

java -jar MCScanner.jar
```

**Option 2: Build from Source**

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Requirements

- JDK 8 or higher
- org.json library (included in `lib/`)

### Build Steps

**Windows:**
```batch
git clone https://github.com/DilanBlue/mc-scanner.git
cd mc-scanner
build.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**

git clone https://github.com/DilanBlue/mc-scanner.git
cd mc-scanner
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Scanning

1. **Enter Server IP** - Domain or IP address (e.g., `play.hypixel.net`)
2. **Set Start Port** - First port to scan (default: `25565`)
3. **Choose Amount** - Number of ports to scan (1-10000)
4. **Select Speed:**
   - `MEDIUM` - Safe, 20 threads (500ms delay)
   - `FAST` - Recommended, 50 threads (125ms delay)
   - `VERY_FAST` - Aggressive, 100 threads (50ms delay)
   - `DANGEROUS` - Maximum, 200 threads (10ms delay)
5. **Click "Start Scan"**

---

## 🔍 WhiteList Detection

The scanner automatically detects if a server has whitelist enabled by:

1. Attempting a login handshake with a fake username
2. Analyzing the disconnect message
3. Detecting keywords: "whitelist", "not whitelisted", "not allowed"

**Accuracy:** ~95% (depends on server configuration)

---

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Legal & Ethical Use

- ✅ **DO**: Scan your own servers
- ✅ **DO**: Test with permission from server owners
- ✅ **DO**: Use reasonable scan amounts (1-500 ports)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Scan without authorization
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use for malicious purposes
- ❌ **DON'T**: Scan entire port ranges (1-65535)

### Rate Limiting

Aggressive scanning may result in:
- IP address blocking by firewalls
- Temporary bans from servers
- ISP throttling or warnings

**Recommendation:** Use `FAST` or `MEDIUM` mode for public servers.

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- WhiteList detection may fail on heavily customized servers
- High ping servers (>1000ms) may timeout
- Some Bedrock Edition servers may not respond correctly
- Large scans (5000+ ports) may consume significant memory

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: javac"
**Solution:** Install JDK (not just JRE)
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

### "package org.json does not exist"
**Solution:** Ensure `lib/json-20231013.jar` exists

### Program hangs during scan
**Solution:** Click "Cancel Scan" button or restart application
